# ISt-687-Intro-to-Data-Science

Compilation of projects completed for the Introduction to Data Science course for the MS in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University

Course Description: The course introduces students to applied examples of data collection, processing, transformation,
management, and analysis to provide students with hands-on introduction to data science
experience. Students will explore key concepts related to data science, including applied
statistics, information visualization, text mining and machine learning. “R”, the open source
statistical analysis and visualization system, will be used throughout the course. R is reckoned by
many to be the most popular choice among data analysts worldwide; having knowledge and skill
with using it is considered a valuable and marketable job skill for most data scientists.
